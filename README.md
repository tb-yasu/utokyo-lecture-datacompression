# Succinct Data Structures for Scalable Knowledge Discoveries

Big data, which includes vast datasets, is experiencing rapid expansion across various application fields. Traditional compression methods and standard data structures often fall short when it comes to processing big data, as they either necessitate decompression for use or consume extensive memory resources. Consequently, these challenges have spurred the development of specialized compressed data structures that support the operations of standard data structures without the need for decompressing. In the field of data compression, such a structure is termed a succinct data structure. This course will introduce succinct data structures and explore their applications in machine learning and data mining.
